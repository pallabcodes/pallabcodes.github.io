Welcome to my technical blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and deep dives into software engineering.

<!-- more -->

## What to Expect

This blog will cover:

- **System Design**: Architectural patterns, trade-offs, and real-world implementations
- **Performance**: Profiling, optimization techniques, and benchmarking
- **Code Quality**: Testing strategies, debugging, and maintainable code
- **Languages & Tools**: Deep dives into Rust, Go, TypeScript, and more

## Why Another Tech Blog?

After working with amazing engineers at various companies, I've realized the value of documenting learnings. This blog is my way of giving back to the community and crystallizing my understanding of complex topics.

## Code Example

Here's a simple Rust function to demonstrate syntax highlighting:

```rust
fn fibonacci(n: u64) -> u64 {
    match n {
        0 => 0,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2),
    }
}
```

Stay tuned for more posts!
